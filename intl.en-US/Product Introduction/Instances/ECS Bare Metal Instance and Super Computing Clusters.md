# ECS Bare Metal Instance and Super Computing Clusters {#concept_lnh_hv2_5db .concept}

ECS Bare Metal \(EBM\) Instance is a new type of computing product that features the elasticity of virtual machines and the performance and characteristics of physical machines. As a product completely and independently developed by Alibaba Cloud, EBM Instance is based on the next-generation of virtualization technology. Compared with the previous generation, not only is the common virtual cloud server supported, but also is nested virtualization. The resource elasticity of common cloud servers is retained, while nested virtualization technology creates a user experience comparable to physical machines.

Super Computing Clusters \(SCCs\) are based on EBM Instances. With the help of the high-speed interconnectivity of RDMA \(Remote Direct Memory Access\) technology, SCCs greatly enhance network performance and increase the acceleration ratio of large-scale clusters. SCCs have all the advantages of EBM Instances and offer high-quality network performance featuring high bandwidth and low latency.

## Advantages {#section_onk_y55_ydb .section}

**EBM Instances**

EBM Instances create value for customers through technological innovation. EBM Instances have the following advantages:

-   **Exclusive computing resources**

    As a cloud-based elastic computing product, the EBM Instances exceed the performance and isolation of contemporary physical machines and enable exclusive computing resources without virtualization performance overheads and feature loss. EBM Instances support 8, 32, and 96 CPU cores and ultrahigh frequency. An EBM Instance with 8 cores, for example, supports an ultrahigh frequency of up to 3.7 to 4.1 GHz, providing better performance and responsiveness for gaming and financial industries than similar products.

-   **Encrypted compute**

    For security, the EBM Instances use a chip-level trusted execution environment \(IntelÂ® SGX\) in addition to physical server isolation. This allows the instances to compute only the encrypted data in a safe and trusted environment, and provides improved security for the customer data on the cloud. This chip-level hardware security protection provides a safe box for the data of cloud users and allows users to control all the data encryption and key protection procedures. For more information, see [Intel SGX](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/help/faq-detail/89858.htm).

-   **Any Stack on Alibaba Cloud**

    EBM Instances combine the performance strengths and features of physical machines and [the ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness of cloud servers](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Benefits of ECS.md#). They can effectively meet your demands for high-performance computing and help you build new hybrid clouds. Due to their flexibility, elasticity, and other strengths, EBM Instances allow you to deploy any stack on them, such as Xen, KVM, and VMWare. As a result, offline private clouds can be seamlessly migrated to Alibaba Cloud without the performance overhead issues that may arise because of nested virtualization. This facilitates a new approach for you to move businesses onto the cloud.

-   **Heterogeneous instruction set processor support**

    The virtualization 2.0 technology used by EBM Instances is independently developed by Alibaba Cloud. It can zero-cost support ARM and other instruction set processors.


**SCC**

SCCs are based on EBM Instance, and were released by Alibaba Cloud to meet the demands of applications such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific or engineering computing, data analysis, and audio and video processing. In the clusters, nodes are connected by Remote Direct Memory Access \(RDMA\) networks featuring high bandwidth and low latency, guaranteeing the highly parallel efficiency demanded by applications that require high-performance computing. Meanwhile, the RoCE \(RDMA over Convergent Ethernet\) rivals an Infiniband network in terms of connection speed, and supports more extensive Ethernet-based applications. The combination of SCCs built on EBM Instance and other Alibaba Cloud computing products such as ECS and GPU servers provides the Alibaba Cloud elastic high-performance computing \(E-HPC\) platform with ultimate high performance parallel computing resources, making supercomputing on the cloud a reality.
