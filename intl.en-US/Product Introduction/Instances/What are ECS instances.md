# What are ECS instances {#concept_i1k_fv2_5db .concept}

An ECS instance is a virtual computing environment that includes CPU, memory, operating system, bandwidth, disks, and other basic computing components.

An ECS instance is an independent virtual machine, and is the core element of ECS. Other resources, such as disks, IPs, images, and snapshots can only be used in conjunction with an ECS instance.
