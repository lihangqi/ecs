# Limits {#concept_gvb_h1w_tdb .concept}

This topic describes the service limits of ECS, and how to apply for exceptions to some limits.

## Overview {#section_nxc_2zs_2gb .section}

ECS has the following service limits:

-   You cannot install virtualization software, such as VMware Workstation, or use it for re-virtualization. Only [ECS Bare Metal Instance](reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/ECS bare metal instance type family/EBM Instance overview.md#) and [Super Computing Cluster](../../../../reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/Super Computing Cluster instance type family/Super Computing Clusters.md#) support re-virtualization.
-   ECS does not support sound card applications.
-   External hardware devices, such as hardware dongles, USB flash drives, external hard disks, and hardware tokens, cannot be attached directly. Software verification methods such as two-factor authentication and dynamic passwords can be used.
-   ECS does not support IP address translation services such as SNAT. Instead, it achieves this function using VPNs and proxies.
-   ECS does not support multicast protocols. We recommend that you use unicast instead.
-   Log Service does not support 32-bit Linux ECS instances. For information about regions that support Log Service, see [Endpoints](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Service endpoint.md#). For information about operating systems that support Log Service, see [Overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Overview/Overview.md#).

## Security groups {#section_mzr_52x_wdb .section}

|Item|Basic security group limits|Advanced security group limits|
|----|---------------------------|------------------------------|
|Total number of security groups in each region for an account|100 You can view the quotas by clicking Privileges & Quota Management on the Overview page in the console. You can open a ticket to apply for an exception to the limit.

 |Same as the basic security group limit|
|Number of classic-type ECS instances that can be included in a classic-type security group|1,000[\*](#)|Classic network is not supported|
|Number of VPC-type ECS instances that can be included in a VPC-type security group|Depends on the [number of private IP addresses in a VPC-type security group](#)|No limit|
|Number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance|5 You can open a ticket to raise the limit to 10 or 16 security groups.

 |Same as the basic security group limit|
|Number of security groups that can contain the same ENI of an ECS instance|
|Maximum number of rules in a security group \(both inbound and outbound\)|100[\*\*\*](#)|Same as the basic security group limit|
|Maximum number of rules in all security groups that contain the same ENI \(both inbound and outbound\)|500|Same as the basic security group limit|
|Number of private IP addresses in a VPC-type security group|2000[\*\*](#)|No limit|
|Number of ENIs in a VPC-type security group|Depends on the [maximum number of rules in a security group](#)|50,000|
|Public network access port|The default STMP port for outbound traffic is port 25, which is disabled by default. It cannot be enabled by security group rules.|Same as the basic security group limit|

\* If more than 1,000 classic-type instances need access to each other, you can distribute them across multiple security groups and authorize mutual access.

\*\* If you require mutual access between more than 2,000 private IP addresses, you can distribute them across multiple security groups and authorize mutual access.

\*\*\* If you increase the number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance, the maximum number of rules in a security group will decrease. The product of the number of security groups that can contain the same ECS instance and the maximum number of rules in a security group \(both inbound and outbound\) must be less than or equal to 500. For example, 5 Ã— 100 = 500, 10 Ã— 50 = 500, and 16 Ã— 30 < 500.
