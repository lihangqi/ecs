# Activate ECS Snapshot {#task_ojj_1tr_lgb .task}

You must activate the Alibaba Cloud ECS Snapshot service before you can create snapshots.

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ecs).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Storage & Snapshots** \> **Snapshots**.
3.  View the statement on the Notifications page that appears, and click **OK** to activate the ECS Snapshot service. 

    **Note:** After you activate ECS Snapshot, you are billed based on the size and storage duration of the created snapshot. Snapshot fees will be deducted from your account balance. Make sure you have compared the snapshot size and the expected fees. For more information about snapshot billing, see [Pricing](https://www.aliyun.com/price/product/#/disk/detail).
