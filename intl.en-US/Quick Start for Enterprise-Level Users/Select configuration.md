As an enterprise-lever user of ECS, you may have specific requirements. To meet your requirements, Alibaba Cloud provides you with recommendations for instance configuration in the following scenarios:

-   **Balanced performance**

    A balanced CPU to memory ratio is required to meet the application resource requirements in most scenarios.

-   **Applications with high packet forwarding rate**

    High packet forwarding rate is required. You can select a more reasonable computing capacity to memory resource ratio based on the specific scenarios.

-   **High performance computing**

    Many computing resources are required. GPU parallel computing and a high clock speed are typical applications in this scenario.

-   **High-performance client games**

    Your services require a high-frequency processor to carry more users. Therefore, a high clock speed is required in this scenario.

-   **Mobile and Web games**

    Many computing resources are required for this scenario. A CPU to memory ratio of 1:2 can help achieve optimal cost performance of computing resources.

-   **Video forwarding**

    Many computing resources are required for this scenario. A CPU to memory ratio of 1:2 can help achieve optimal cost performance of computing resources.

-   **Live bullet screen**

    High packet forwarding rate is required for this scenario. You can select a more reasonable computing capacity to memory resource ratio based on the specific scenarios.

-   **Relational databases**

    In this scenario, SSD cloud disks or higher-performance NVMe SSD local disks are required to provide higher IOPS capability and a low read latency. The CPU to memory ratio is balanced \(1:4\) or the memory proportion is larger \(1:8\).

-   **Distributed cache**

    In this scenario, a balanced CPU to memory ratio \(1:4\) or a higher memory proportion \(1:8\), and stable computing performance are required.

-   **NoSQL databases**

    In this scenario, SSD cloud disks or higher-performance NVMe SSD local disks are required to provide higher IOPS capacity and a low read latency. The CPU to memory ratio is balanced \(1:4\) or the memory proportion is larger \(1:8\).

-   **Elastic search**

    In this scenario, SSD cloud disks or higher-performance NVMe SSD local disks are required to provide higher IOPS capacity and a low read latency. The CPU to memory ratio is balanced \(1:4\) or the memory proportion is larger \(1:8\).

-   **Hadoop**

    Data nodes require a high disk throughput, high network throughput, and balanced CPU to memory ratio. Computing nodes focus more on the computing performance, network bandwidth, and CPU to memory ratio.

-   **Spark**

    Data nodes require a high disk throughput, high network throughput, and balanced CPU to memory ratio. Computing nodes focus more on the computing performance, network bandwidth, and CPU to memory ratio.

-   **Kafka**

    Data nodes require a high disk throughput, high network throughput, and balanced CPU to memory ratio. Computing nodes focus more on the computing performance, network bandwidth, and CPU to memory ratio.

-   **Machine learning**

    In this scenario, a high performance Nvidia GPU computing processor is required, and the memory size must be at least twice the video memory.

-   **Video encoding**

    In this scenario, a high performance GPU computing processor or a high performance CPU is required for encoding and decoding.

-   **Rendering**

    In this scenario, a high performance GPU computing processor is required for rendering.
