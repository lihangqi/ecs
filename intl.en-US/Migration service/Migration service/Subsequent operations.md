# Subsequent operations {#concept_fmz_ykk_yfb .concept}

This topic describes the subsequent operations that you need to perform after you migrate your servers to Alibaba Cloud. The purpose of these operations is to ensure that the system can operate normally.

## Create an instance {#section_cb1_msq_yfb .section}

After you migrate a number of servers to Alibaba Cloud, you obtain the same number of custom images. You need to use these custom images to create instances and test the system. We recommend the following use scenarios based on the relative number of instances that you create.

-   Create a small number of instances

    If you need to create only a small number of instances, then we recommend that you use custom images to create the instances on the ECS instance purchase page in the ECS console. When you create an instance, you can select **Pay-As-You-Go** as the billing method, and specify the VPC, VSwitch, and security group, among other network parameters. Then, you can modify the IP address to the specified intranet IP address.

-   Create a large number of instances

    If you need to create a large number of instances, make sure that you do the following:

    -   Create Pay-As-You-Go instances for testing, and then convert these instances to Subscription instances.
    -   Maintain the subnet IP address of the original system to maintain the previous service scenario.
    -   Use an appropriate tool to create instances in batches.
    To write a script to call the Alibaba Cloud CLI and use the CLI to call the relevant API, follow these steps:


1.  Download the Alibaba Cloud CLI and configure an AccessKeyId and AccessKeySecret. For more information, see [What is the Alibaba Cloud CLI](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/66653.htm?spm=a2c63.l28256.a3.1.6acaa893PiO7j3).

2.  Call the API [RunInstances](../../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Instances/RunInstances.md#) to create one or more instances.

    For example, if the region in which you want to create an instance is cn-qingdao, the image ID is m-xxxxxxxxx, the VSwitch is vsw-xxxxxxx, the subnet IP address is 10.0.0.10, and the instance type is ecs.n1.samll. Then, call the API by using the following code:

    ```
    aliyun ecs CreateInstance --RegionId 'cn-qingdao' --ImageId 'm-xxxxxxxxx' --VSWitchId 'vsw-xxxxxxx' --PrivateIP '10.0.0.10' --InstanceType 'ecs.n1.samll'
    ```

3.  Write a script that contains the image ID and the subnet IP address generated by the Cloud Migration tool, and then call the Alibaba Cloud CLI to automatically read the information and create instances in batches.


**Note:** After you create instances in batches and start these instances, you can use the [Cloud assistant](../../../../../intl.en-US/Deployment & Maintenance/Cloud assistant/Cloud assistant.md#) to manage and configure the instances.

## Check a migrated Linux server {#section_kmh_c5q_yfb .section}

1.  Ensure that the system disk data is complete.
2.  If you have a data disk, attach it to an ECS instance. For more information, see [Attach a cloud disk](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/25446.htm?spm=a2c63.l28256.b99.190.196f7453DYu0mr).
3.  Ensure that the network operates normally.
4.  Ensure that other systems operate normally.

## Check a migrated Windows server {#section_rqx_d5q_yfb .section}

1.  Ensure that the system disk data is complete.
2.  If any data disk is lost, start the disk management tool to check whether any driver letter is lost.
3.  Wait until the restoration process is finished, and then restart the instance.

    **Note:** The restoration process is used to repair the permissions of the file system. If the file system does not start the restoration process automatically after you start an ECS instance for the first time, you can run the C:\\go2aliyun\_prepare\\go2aliyun\_restore.exe command to conduct a manual repair. Before you run the command, you need to ensure that the number and path of the disks in the instance is the same as those in the original system.
