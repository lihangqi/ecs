# Scenarios {#concept_tnv_mcx_ydb .concept}

As a simple and efficient data protection method, snapshots are recommended for the following scenarios:

-   Routine backup of system and data disks. You can back up business-critical data at regular intervals by using snapshots to avoid data loss caused by misoperations, attacks, viruses, and others.

-   Before important operations such as replacing system disks, upgrading application software, or migrating business data, you must create one or more snapshots. In case that any issue occurs during an upgrade or migration, you can timely restore it to normal status by using the snapshots.

-   Using of multiple copies of production data. You can take snapshots of production data to provide close-to-real-time production data for data mining, report queries, and developing and testing applications.
