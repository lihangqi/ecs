# Release a cloud disk {#concept_bly_hrh_ydb .concept}

We recommend you release a cloud disk when you no longer require it to avoid incurring excess fees. Releasing a cloud disk is a permanent, irreversible action and is irreversible. After its release, data on the cloud disk cannot be restored. You can only release a cloud disk in the Available status. Exercise caution when performing this action.

## Note {#section_kyx_lrh_ydb .section}

When releasing a cloud disk, note that

-   Only cloud disks that are in the **Available** status can be released independently. Other cloud disks, such as those used as system disks, or Subscription billed cloud disks used as data disks, can only be released together with ECS instances. Â If a cloud disk is in the **In Use** status, you must first Detach it from the instance.

-   By default, automatic snapshots are released together with their cloud disks. However, manually created snapshots are not. You can change the snapshot release configuration when attaching a cloud disk.

    **Note:** Each cloud disk can have up to 64 snapshots. To make sure you have sufficient storage space for the automatic snapshots, we recommend that you release automatically or manually created snapshots that you no longer require.

-   You can have data backed up before releasing a cloud disk. For example, by creating a snapshot.
