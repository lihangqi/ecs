# Remove an instance from a security group {#task_hcr_ptm_1gb .task}

You can remove an ECS instance from one of its security groups as needed. If an instance is removed from a security group, it can no longer communicate with other instances in that group over the intranet. Therefore, we recommend that you conduct sufficient tests before the removal to ensure that your business runs normally after removal.

The ECS instance has been added to two or more security groups.

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/login-required#/ecs).
