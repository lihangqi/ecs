# Delete snapshots or automatic snapshot policies {#concept_ch5_2pl_xdb .concept}

When you no longer require a snapshot, or you have reached your snapshot quota, we recommend you delete unnecessary snapshots to free up space and avoid being charged for excessive fees.

**Note:** 

-   After a snapshot is deleted, it cannot be restored. Exercise caution when performing this action.
-   If a snapshot has been used to create a custom image, you must delete the associated image before you can delete the snapshot.
