# Change the operating system {#concept_e12_vfd_xdb .concept}

You can convert the OS running on your ECS instance to another supported OS through the ECS console.

To change the operating system, you must change the system disk of an instance:

-   If you want to use a custom image, see [change the system disk \(custom image\)](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Cloud disks/Change the system disk (custom image).md#).
-   If you want to use a public image, seeÂ [change a system disk \(public image\)](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Cloud disks/Change a system disk (public image).md#).

**Note:** Currently, instances that are hosted in regions outside of mainland China do not support swapping between Linux and Windows OSs. If your instance is hosted in one of these regions, you can only change its version of Windows OS to another version of Windows, or replace its current Linux OS with another Linux OS.
