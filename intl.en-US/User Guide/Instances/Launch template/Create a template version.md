# Create a template version {#concept_nhb_3y5_xdb .concept}

One template can have multiple versions. The default version number of a newly created template is 1, and you can create additional versions based on this template. The version number increments automatically as you create a new version. You cannot customize the version number, but you can set any of the template versions as the default version.

**Note:** 

-   Each template can have a maximum of 30 versions.
-   All parameters are optional when you create a template version.
-   A template version cannot be modified once you have created it.

You can create a template version using the following methods:

-   [Create an instance using the ECS console](#console) to create versions of a template for future use.

-   [Create an instance on the ECS buy page](#commonbuy) to create an instance, save its configurations, and create versions of a template.
