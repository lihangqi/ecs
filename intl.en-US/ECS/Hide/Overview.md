# Overview {#EcsApiAuthoritarian .concept}

By default, you have full operation permissions on your resources, and you can use all APIs described in this document to operate on your resources. You can use your Alibaba Cloud account to create RAM users, and an unauthorized ram user cannot operate on resources of the Alibaba Cloud account. You must grant the permission to the RAM user to operate on resources of the Alibaba Cloud account by the RAM authorization.

Make sure that you have read the [RAM](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/What is RAM?.md#) and [API](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/API overview.md#) documentation carefully before you use RAM to authorize access to ECS instances.

Skip this section if you do not need to grant an RAM user to access ECS instance resources in an Alibaba Cloud Account. Skipping this section does not affect your understanding and usage of the ECS API. For more information, see [authentication rules](intl.en-US/API Reference/Authorization rules.md#).
