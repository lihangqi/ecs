# ReInitDisk {#doc_api_1030734 .reference}

Resets a disk to its initial state .

## Description {#description .section}

When you call this operation, note that:

-   The operation can be performed only when the disk is in the In\_use state and the instance that the disk is attached to is in the Stopped state.
-   If the instance has not been activated for the first time after creation, the disks attached to it cannot be reinitialized.
-   A system disk will be initialized to the initial status of the image. If the source image used to create the disk is deleted, the disk cannot be initialized.
-   A user-created data disk will be initialized to the state of an empty data disk.
-   A data disk that was created from a snapshot will be initialized to the state of the snapshot. If the source snapshot used to create the disk is deleted, the disk cannot be initialized and an error will be returned.
