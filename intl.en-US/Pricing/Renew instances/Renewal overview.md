# Renewal overview {#concept_dzp_g2d_5db .concept}

If you want to continue using a Subscription instance after it expires, you must renew the instance within the prescribed period. Otherwise, both the instance and disk are automatically released. The stored data is erased permanently and cannot be recovered. For more information about what happens when a Subscription instance expires, see [Subscription](reseller.en-US/Pricing/Subscription.md#).

**Note:** 

-   You cannot cancel a paid renewal order.
-   Pay-As-You-Go instances do not involve renewal. Make sure you have sufficient balance on your linked credit card or PayPal account to cover the costs.
