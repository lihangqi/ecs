4.  Locate the auto provisioning group that you want to delete, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column. You can also select multiple auto provisioning groups and click **Delete Group** to batch delete the groups.
5.  Choose whether to delete the instances in the auto provisioning group. An auto provisioning group can mitigate the effects caused by reclaimed preemptible instances. If you choose not to delete the instances, you must monitor the running status of the preemptible instances to avoid service interruptions.
6.  Click **OK**.
