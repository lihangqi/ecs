# EBM Instance overview {#concept_lnh_hv2_5db .concept}

This topic describes ECS Bare Metal \(EBM\) Instances and the instance type families that provide EBM Instance types \(specifically, high-clock speed type family ebmhfg5, compute type family ebmc4, and general-purpose type family ebmg5\).

## Background information {#section_mh2_uj0_w3p .section}

Alibaba Cloud EBM Instances use next-generation virtualization technology that supports multiple virtual cloud servers and nested virtualization while also maintaining excellent resource elasticity and a seamless user experience.

Compared with other available instance types, EBM Instances offer the following advantages:

-   **Exclusive computing resources** 

    EBM Instances provide better performance and isolation than standard physical servers and enable exclusive computing resources without virtualization performance overheads or feature loss. EBM Instances support 8, 32, and 96 CPU cores and ultra high frequencies. For example, an EBM Instance with 8 cores supports a frequency of up to 3.7 to 4.1 GHz.

-   **Chip-level security** 

    EBM Instances implement IntelÂ® SGX, which allows EBM Instances to compute only encrypted data in a safe and trusted environment, providing advanced security for your data in the cloud. For more information, see [Install SGX](reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/ECS bare metal instance type family/Install SGX.md#).

-   **Compatible with multiple private clouds** 

    EBM Instances supports re-virtualization. As a result, private cloud users can seamlessly migrate to Alibaba Cloud without experiencing performance overhead issues that typically occur in standard nested virtualization methods.

-   **Support for heterogeneous instruction set processors** 

    EBM Instances are based on proprietary virtualization 2.0 technology developed by Alibaba Cloud, which support ARM and other instruction set processors without incurring additional costs.


When you use EBM Instances, note the following:

-   The specifications of EBM Instances cannot be upgraded or downgraded.
-   If a hardware fault occurs to an EBM Instance, a failover occurs and data is stored in the cloud disks of the EBM Instance.

## Comparison of EBM Instances, physical machines, and virtual machines {#section_efq_x55_ydb .section}
