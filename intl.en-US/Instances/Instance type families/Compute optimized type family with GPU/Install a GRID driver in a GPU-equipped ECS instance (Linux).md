# Install a GRID driver in a GPU-equipped ECS instance \(Linux\) {#concept_66441_zh .concept}

This topic describes how to install a GRID driver and build a desktop environment in a GPU-equipped ECS instance running Linux of the following instance type families: gn5, gn5i, gn6v, gn6i, and vgn5i.

## Background information {#section_ytw_b8e_s7w .section}

If your GPU-equipped instance requires OpenGL, you must install the GRID driver on the instance. This is because the NVIDIA GRID license granted to NVIDIA GPUs \(such as Tesla P100, Tesla P4 and Tesla V100\) of the supported instances cannot meet the graphics requirements of OpenGL.

## Prerequisites {#section_9c5_9di_rqw .section}

-   A GPU compute instance that can access the Internet is created. For more information, see [Create a compute optimized instance with GPU](reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/Compute optimized type family with GPU/Create a compute optimized instance with GPU.md#).

    **Note:** We recommend that you select a **Public Image**. If you select a **Marketplace Image** that is pre-installed with an NVIDIA driver, after the instance is created, you must disable the Nouveau driver through this process: create a file named nouveau.conf in the /etc/modprobe.d directory, and then add `blacklist nouveau` to it.

-   VNC software \(such as VNC Viewer, which is used in this example\) is installed.

## Install a GRID driver in Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit {#part1 .section}

To install the GRID driver, follow these steps:

1.  [Connect to the Linux instance](../reseller.en-US/Instances/Connect to instances/Connect to Linux instances/Connect to a Linux instance by using a password.md#).
2.  Run the following commands in sequence to upgrade the system and install the KDE.

    ```language-shell
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install kubuntu-desktop					
    ```

3.  Run `reboot` to restart the system.
4.  [Connect to the Linux instance](../reseller.en-US/Instances/Connect to instances/Connect to Linux instances/Connect to a Linux instance by using a password.md#) again, and then run the following commands to download and decompress the NVIDIA GRID driver package.

    The NVIDIA GRID driver package contains the drivers for various operating systems. For Linux OS, select **NVIDIA-Linux-x86\_64-390.57-grid.run**.

    ```language-shell
    wget http://nvdia-driver-410.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.39-grid.run					
    ```

5.  Run the following commands in sequence, then follow the prompts to install the NVIDIA GRID driver.

    ```language-shell
    chmod 777 NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.39-grid.run
    ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-410.39-grid.run
    ```

6.  Run `nvidia-smi` to verify the installation.

    If the following message appears, the driver is installed successfully.

7.  Add License Server to activate the license:
    1.  Switch to the /etc/nvidia directory: `cd /etc/nvidia`.
    2.  Create a file named gridd.conf: `cp gridd.conf.template gridd.conf`.
    3.  Add the following lines about License Server to the gridd.conf file.

        ```language-shell
        ServerAddress=IP address of the License server
        ServerPort=Port of the License server (defaulted to 7070)
        FeatureType=2
        EnableUI=TRUE
        ```

8.  Run the following command to install x11vnc.

    ```language-shell
    apt-get install x11vnc					
    ```

9.  Run `lspci | grep NVIDIA` to check GPU BusID.

    In this example, the GPU BusID is `00:07.0`.

10. Configure the X Server environment and restart the system:
    1.  Run `nvidia-xconfig --enable-all-gpus --separate-x-screens`.
    2.  Edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf: Add your GPU BusID to the `Section "Device"`. In this example, `BusID "PCI:0:7:0" is added`.

    3.  Run `reboot` to restart the system.

## Verify installation { .section}

To verify the installation of the GRID driver, follow these steps:

1.  Run the following command to install the GLX application.

    ```language-shell
    apt-get install mesa-utils					
    ```

2.  Run `startx` to start X Server.

    **Note:** 

    -   If the `startx` command cannot be found, run `apt-get install xinit` to install it.
    -   Running `startx` may result in the `hostname: Name or service not known` error. This error has no effect on starting X Server. Run `hostname` to obtain the host name of the instance, and then modify the /etc/hosts file by replacing the `hostname`, which is preceded by `127.0.0.1`, with the actual host name of your instance.

3.  Start a new terminal session of the SSH client and run the following command to start x11vnc.

    ```language-shell
    x11vnc -display :1					
    ```

    If the following message appears, x11vnc has been restarted successfully. At this stage, you can connect to the instance by using a VNC application. In this example, VNC Viewer is used.

4.  Log on to the ECS console, and [add security group rules](../reseller.en-US/Security/Security groups/Add security group rules.md#) to the target security group to allow inbound traffic from the Internet through the TCP 5900 port.
5.  On the local machine, start VNC Viewer and enter the `public IP address of the instance:5900` to connect to the instance and enter the KDE desktop.
6.  Run `glxinfo` to view the configurations supported by the current GRID driver:
    1.  Start a new terminal session of the SSH client.
    2.  Run `export DISPLAY=:1`.
    3.  Run `glxinfo â€“t` to list the configurations supported by the current GRID driver.
7.  Run `glxgears` to test the GRID driver:
    1.  On the KDE desktop, right-click the desktop and select **Run Command**.
    2.  Run `glxgears` to start the testing application. If the following figure appears, the GRID driver works normally.
