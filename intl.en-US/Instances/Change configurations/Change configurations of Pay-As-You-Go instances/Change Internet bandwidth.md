# Change Internet bandwidth {#concept_eqg_jbf_5db .concept}

This topic describes how to change Internet bandwidth of a Pay-As-You-Go instance if the current bandwidth does not meet service requirements.

If you are using a VPC-connected ECS instance to which [an Elastic IP \(EIP\) address is attached](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/27714.htm), you can use the **Change Bandwidth** feature to change the Internet bandwidth as needed, regardless of your billing method.

## Limits {#section_jzn_d3z_xdb .section}

The **Change Bandwidth** feature only applies to VPC-connected instances to which an EIP address is attached.

For Subscription instances of the classic network type or VPC-connected ECS instances to which no EIP addresses are attached, you can use the following features to change the Internet bandwidth:

-   [Upgrade configurations of Subscription instances](reseller.en-US/Instances/Change configurations/Upgrade configurations/Upgrade configurations of Subscription instances.md#) to change the Internet bandwidth immediately.

-   [Renew for configuration downgrade](../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Renew instances/Renew for configuration downgrade.md#) to change the Internet bandwidth for the next billing cycle.
