# Step 1. Select configuration {#concept_ef3_c2h_vdb .concept}

We recommend the following configuration schemes, which can meet the requirements of most users. For more information, see [Instance type families](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Instance type families.md#).

This article is applicable to entry-level users.

-   Entry level:

    1-core CPU, 1 GiB memory and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth. This scheme is applicable to personal sites at their initial stage with relatively low traffic.

-   Advanced:

    1-core CPU, 2 GiB memory and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth. This scheme is applicable to the websites with moderate traffic, simple development environments and codebase.

-   General:

    2-core CPU, 4 GiB memory and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth. This scheme is applicable to enterprise operations, parallel computing applications and common data processing. It can meet the requirements of 90% cloud computing users.

-   Ideal:

    4-core CPU, 8 GiB memory and 1 Mbit/s bandwidth. This scheme is applicable to services requiring higher computing performance, for example, enterprise operations, batch processing, distributed analysis, and applications.


These recommended configuration schemes are only for reference when you start using an ECS. For subscription users, if the configuration is found to be excessively high or low during use, you can modify the configuration at any time to upgrade or degrade the configuration scheme.

For more information about web hosting, see [Web Hosting Solution](https://www.alibabacloud.com/solutions/hosting).

After confirming the configuration scheme, you can start to create an ECS instance.
